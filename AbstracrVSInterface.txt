ABSTRACT CLASS
An abstract class can inherit a class and multiple interfaces.
An abstract class can have methods with a body.
An abstract class method is implemented using the override keyword.
An abstract class is a better option when you need to implement common methods and declare common abstract methods.
An abstract class can declare constructors and destructors.
If you want to declare an abstract member in abstract class then abstract keyword is mandatory.	


INTERFACE
An interface can inherit multiple interfaces but cannot inherit a class.
An interface cannot have methods with a body.
An interface method is implemented without using the override keyword.
An interface is a better option when you need to declare only abstract methods.
An interface cannot declare constructors or destructors.
If you want to declare an abstract member in interface then abstract keyword is not mandatory because members of interface are abstract by default.
