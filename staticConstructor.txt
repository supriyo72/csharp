//static constructor
// A static constructor is used to initialize static variables of the class and to perform a particular action only once.
// It is invoked before any static member of the class is accessed.
// A static constructor does not take any parameters and does not use any access modifiers because it is invoked directly by the CLR instead of the object.
// only one static constructor can be created in the class
// it is called automatically before the first instance of the class created
//we cannot call static constructor directly
